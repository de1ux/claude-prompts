# interviews

To find interview files, go to `/Users/nathan.evans/Documents/Obsidian Vault/interviews`

# Finish my interview

1. Create a consolidated timeline. Look for timeline notes like

```
10:02: c has started coding
the coding is going well
they're asking questions
10:04 c has stopped coding
10:04 me: introduced first OOM
10:09 c questions about memory allocation
```

Note that timeline notes can be interspersed throughout the interview doc. So look for contiguous blocks of text to find where I jotted down notes, and include the text that has a timestamp and doesn't (but is immediately adjacent to the timestamp text)

Expand "c" to candidate, expand "me" to interviewer

2. Next, create a pros/cons block from my notes.

Always put the pros/cons and conclusion at the top of the interview file, but after the table with the Excalidraw link, etc.
